# Office Notice Board

Summary TBD

## Todo

Software:

- Nicely format config and display websites
  - Config: Set text to API server (should see it on display now)
  - Set states from dropdown or custom text
  - Four states: On call (dnd), working, not home, custom text/drawing (bring me cookies)
- Cleanup code
- Readme update
- Figure out scheduler and backlight timer stuff

Hardware & Mounting:

- LCD Screen: Weatherized and mounted right outside the guest house by the door.
  - 3D printed case?
  - Power? – Solar Panel
- Expense everything later in the year

Post MVP:

- Automatically detect if I'm in a conference call or not
- If in a conference call, update the text so Camille knows if I'm in a meeting or she can come in
- Start here? <https://github.com/henrik242/OnAir>
- Blog post
